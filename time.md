# Work Log

### 19/03/2024
1. Install symfony docker and get it working # 10m
2. Import the checker interface and create service with empty stubs # 5m
3. Install PHPUnit and Write basic unit tests - which at this point will fail # 10m
4. Add dataproviders to the unit tests to help test edge cases # 15m
5. Creating initial implementations of functions # 1h30m
    a. making simplest solution that passes all tests
    b. thinking about dataprovider test cases
    c. deciding if more requirements need to be captured and writing email with questions
6. Updating instructions mark down

Total: 2h10m

Taking a break at this point. Possibly a minimum viable product has been achieved depending on answers to email. No requirements were given in terms of optimisation, but next session will be looking at ways to improve the speed and make sure code quality is high.

### Todo next session
* Writing stress tests to obtain timings
* Further optimisation of algorithms
* Thinking about possibility of caching common checks using redis
* Thinking about next steps
